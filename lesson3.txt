When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When there are many people working on the repository and you want it to be globally accessible. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Whenever some changes are made in the repository that are worthwile for keeping in the project only then the changes will be pulled rather
than being automatically all the time.
