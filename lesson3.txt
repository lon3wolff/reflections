When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When there are many people working on the repository and you want it to be globally accessible. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Whenever some changes are made in the repository that are worthwile for keeping in the project only then the changes will be pulled rather
than being automatically all the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks-They are used for github to github cloning. Its kind of a shortcut and useful when you dont have permission to clone.
clones- They are used to copy a repository into local.
branches- They are used to diverge from the master branch for making changes not visible on the master branch which can be kept later
if wanted using merge.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Sometimes we don't want to merge remote with the local but just want to keep in different branch so that when we require it
we could see the diff changes and merge later according to need therefore git fetch is used inpite of git pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using Git or Github we could collabrate with the old ways like creating project on own and then sending the mails to one
another of the updates made. Previously no one focused on the area of making working together easy and thats what make it unique thought 
its complicated and harder to learn and remember all those commands.
